            My journey started as a curious learner exploring 
            <em>web development</em>, mobile applications, and 
            problem-solving with algorithms. Over time, Iâ€™ve developed 
            strong foundations in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, 
            C++, Java, Kotlin, Flutter</strong>, and frameworks like 
            <strong>React Native & Laravel</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond coding, I am highly motivated by challenges and teamwork. 
            I believe in <span class="highlight">continuous learning</span>, 
            exploring innovative solutions, and contributing to projects that 
            create a real difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            âœ¨ Fun fact: I enjoy blending design and logic, making my projects 
            not only functional but also visually appealing.  
            ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m exploring <strong>Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)</strong> 
            and advanced <strong>AI/ML integrations</strong>.
